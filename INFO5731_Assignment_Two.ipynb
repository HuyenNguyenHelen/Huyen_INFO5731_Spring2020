            "[[\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.', \"Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.\\nRemarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.\\nI don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.\\nOSCARS are on their way!\", 'Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven\\'t seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.', \"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE.

If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally.

I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes.

The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall.

Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe.

The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout.

Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be.

Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world.

Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high.

Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though.

Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence.

Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world.

There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph.

Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger.

Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline.

Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers.

Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be.

Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain.

The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices).

Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.', \"Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.\\nRemarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.\\nI don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.\\nOSCARS are on their way!\", 'Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven\\'t seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.', \"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago...

Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger.

Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be.

Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain.

It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices).

This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence.

Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be.

We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close).

Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it.

It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain.

It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout.

It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout.

The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], [\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence.

And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.\\nRemarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.\\nI don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.\\nOSCARS are on their way!\", 'Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven\\'t seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.', \"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\"], ['Joaquin\\' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man\\'s transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.\\nEdit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.', 'Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades.

Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring.

I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too.

You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them.', \"Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.\", \"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.', \"Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker?

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.\\nEdit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.', 'Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add).

His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker.

And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention.

If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they\\'re not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they\\'re \"incels\" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan\\'s marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger\\'s Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.', \"Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy.

He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.\\nEdit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.', 'Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add).

And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film.

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they\\'re not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they\\'re \"incels\" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan\\'s marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger\\'s Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight.

Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story.

He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.\\nEdit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.', 'Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring.

The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great.

This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy.

The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring.

I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add).

This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary.

His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker.

And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention.

Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight.

Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie.

When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great.

If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier.

It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love.

I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me.

When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring.

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick.

The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary.

In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight.

Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up.

There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie.

The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add).

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours.

And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker?

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian.

The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies.

A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting.

The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\".

In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys).

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever....

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study.

The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression.

I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight.

Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film.

Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back! But this time they\\'re not pranksters mimicking Pennywise to scare the sh*t out of people for viral memes; they\\'re \"incels\" threatening to gun down everyone who chooses to take their date to this dour, depressing, demented movie.If this Joker were the one featured in Nolan\\'s marvelously entertaining Dark Knight, I doubt any of your skinny lonely drugged-up psychos would be rushing to hail this guy as his hero and inspiration.Ledger\\'s Joker is brilliant, manipulaitve, and consumed with an infectious, and sometimes charming, confidence. Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight. Events spiral out of control in Joker.There is no fun in this movie, no great action set pieces, no hint of hope or optimism. It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful. Who wants that movie?There are plenty of good character-driven films of mentally disturbed individuals who spiral out of control. There are plenty of good dark gritty super hero movies. This is neither of them.', \"Yes Joaquin's performance is good and the cinematography is pretty but otherwise I do not get all the hype about this movie.Not for a long time have I felt like I would be better off leaving the cinema than staying and getting my money's worth.For something that was supposed to be gritty and real it had a lot of convenient scenes to help push the plot along.Very disappointed.\", \"I thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much. The character doesn't even stay true to the comics and the director flat out said it didn't, and then they made it seem like it was part of Gothams fall and he was just a little boy that had a laughing problem... Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.', \"Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie. This was more of if Joker was though of outside of the DC world. I think since movie imagination and creativity has bern lost through cgi , we take a movie such as this and make a huge deal of it. So ehhh it was good but Stop with the hype.', 'Everything about Joker apart from the performance from Phoenix was fine. The score was pretty good as well I guess.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material. This film is little more than a remake of \"Taxi Driver\" with elements (most notably the end) borrowed from \"Network\".\\nIn the case of \"Taxi Driver\" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie.

Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer.

It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed.\", 'Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!'], ['\"Joker\" is nor a \"masterpiece\" nor is it \"flawless\" as this board boasts. It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story.

What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do.

DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it.

Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off!

It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off!

So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it.

But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off!

This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent.

The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie.

Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated?

Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off!

This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe.

A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is.

This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker.

This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling...

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.)

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit.

Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing.

Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen.

This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.)

Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters.\", 'I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar.

Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes.

There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker.

Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever.

A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that \"hey, he\\'s still funny at times\"... But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... \"it\\'s deep\", \"my feels\", \"It\\'s not a superhero movie it\\'s a character study\", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as..

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

It\\'s mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix\\'s part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding.

But with the strained mental illness angle it\\'s difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you\\'re laughing at. The real \"danger\" this movie poses is that it\\'s another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling...

It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters.\", 'I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe.

A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer.

It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed.\", 'Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level.

Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting.

A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different!

This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar!

This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying...

At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy.

Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix.

Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time.

In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy.

No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny.

And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it.

It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same!

And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film.

Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense.

They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix.

Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie.

This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar!

This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously?

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy.

I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie.

People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals....

And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie.

This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar!

At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy.

When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix.

Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time.

What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny.

PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece.

This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it.

It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same!

The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film.

Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense.

People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped.

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy.

With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds.

A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals....

When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior.

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix.

Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time.

But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY.

I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece.

This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour.

It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it.

It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same!

The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film.

Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense.

People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed\\nThe acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until nowI would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it', 'Do not lead to torturing children (mother) nor murdering people.', 'I don\\'t get it. I think it\\'s a case of \"everyone thinks this is great so I should too\". I was definitely not impressed.', 'What can I say about it that hasn\\'t already been said? It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.'], [\"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character... What a shocker a guy gets of his meds and kills a talk show host... I\\'m so shocked... Little does everyone know the real \"Joker\" falls into a pool of chemicals. At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan. Or resorc', \"No one cares about your country's inability to separate Reel and Real influences. Film is a medium not just for political ideals or comments.Watch it\", \"Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy. The ending he kills the talk show host?? Wow that was just anti-climatic overall just a waste of time to be honest.\", \"JOKER is a gift to the audiences. I felt as a privileged person to sit in a movie theater and watching it. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips gave to the world of cinema a rear pearl.

Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it.\", 'I have looked forward to this movie for a long time. A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals....

            "[\"I was a person that saw all the hype and claims of masterpiece as overreacting and overblown excitement for another Joker based film. I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout. When this film was over the place was blown away and every audience member was awestruck that they witnessed a film that could still transport them into a character's world and very existence. Believe the hype. This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema.\", \"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.\", 'This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.', \"Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.\\nRemarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.\\nI don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.\\nOSCARS are on their way!\", 'Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven\\'t seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.', \"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime\", \"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director\", \"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.\", \"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.\\nIt's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.\", \"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.\\nTo enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.\", 'I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn\\'t get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn\\'t let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can\\'t guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his \"small\" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.', 'This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn\\'t for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren\\'t able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn\\'t the best movie for you.', 'The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.', 'I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.', 'The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way.', \"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.\\nI went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.\\nWhat we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!\", \"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.\", \"Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.Final Grade - 9/10\", \"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\\nWhat doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.\\nAnother thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\\nAlso I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.\\nIn conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.\", 'Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing', \"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.\", \"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.\", \"The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.\", 'Joaquin\\' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man\\'s transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we\\'ve never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we\\'re almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he\\'s the joker, we wish we could\\'ve helped him. There\\'s a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don\\'t need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10', \"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.\", \"In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it.\", 'The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\"\\n& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.\\nChoreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.\\nThe cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.\\nEdit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.', 'Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.', 'I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don\\'t buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta \"standup\" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it\\'s just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn\\'t make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.\\nIs this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.', 'The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don\\'t have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker\\'s life, I begin to get it.', \"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.\\nSomeone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.\\nNormally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.\\nI wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.\\nComing to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.\\nDefinitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away\\n1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.\", 'Still days after seeing it, I\\'m still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who\\'s watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don\\'t see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.\\nThe film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant \"Taxi Driver\" and \"King of Comedy\" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese\\'s best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from \"Taxi Driver\" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from \"The King of Comedy\".\\nThe film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child\\'s hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn\\'t know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother\\'s house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I\\'m not gonna go any further into plot details since the film\\'s not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn\\'t have the name \"Joker\" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don\\'t get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.\\nAlthough I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That\\'s probably my only negative with this film.\\nBut still; it\\'s a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to \"The Killing Joke\" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!\\nI\\'m gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix\\'s greatness and even Robert De Niro\\'s acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it\\'s amazing. I can\\'t wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76', 'I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.I watched it and was bored. the astectics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performence of the joker was a good performence but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many. this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGGThis movie is bang average and way overhyped.\\nphenoix performence is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrums of performence.I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.there is a real world out there.', \"Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time\", 'The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can\\'t get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that \"THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie\" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you\\'re nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This \"my comic publisher is better than yours\" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you\\'re in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that\\'s not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn\\'t been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like \"HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!\", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it\\'s too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the \"Don\\'t smile\" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn\\'t impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told \"sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?\", and I\\'m sorry, but I\\'m just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it\\'s technically a superhero movie because $$$ and P.S. HEY KIDS DID YOU LIKE HOW WE USED THE PUBLIC\\'S FEAR OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM TO SELL OUR PRODUCT TO YOU BECAUSE THAT\\'S HOW EDGY IT IS?', \"Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.\", \"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.\", 'Simply put, this movie is no masterpiece and if you think it is, you need to see WAY more movies. And by way more movies, I mean movies that aren\\'t superhero movies. The funny thing about all the people who call this movie \"a masterpiece\" is that they can\\'t qualify that claim in any way. Try it for yourself - ask the next person you talk to about Joker why it\\'s a masterpiece. If you\\'re lucky, you might get a response that goes as deep as them saying something vague about the writing and directing being amazing. Ask them to explain that. I guarantee you they won\\'t be able to. This movie is one note, from beginning to end. Joker is crazy at the start, and crazy at the end. There is zero nuance, subtlety or character development. He simply goes from being crazy to crazier. It is cynical, lazy and a dull retread of the REAL masterpieces (like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy) from which it shamelessly steals (poorly, I might add). Beware of anyone who calls this a masterpiece, they have zero understanding of cinema.', \"One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene\", 'BREAKING NEWS: Killer clowns are back!

Phoenix\\'s Joker is dumb, depressing, and insecure. Ledger makes things happen. Things happen to Phoenix. The Joker controls events in Dark Knight.

It\\'s a two hour slog of watching a miserable man drive himself insane until he starts murdering people. Then seemingly everyone goes insane because \"they\\'ve had enough!\"Change the name of this movie to Arthur, eliminate the very few references to the Batman universe, and I doubt you\\'d think this was an origin story to the Joker we all know and love. Maybe this Joker is the closest to what the Joker would resemble in the real world...which is perhaps why this movie is so awful.

Hated it\", 'What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.', \"Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds.

I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.There were many other scenes that defied belief:A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.Etc.Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.\", 'It was well played film. Of course JF does his due diligence. However, people blew this up because thats all people do these days is talk about everything thats not real life. Was a good different spin on a DC comic movie.

Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie', 'I don\\'t write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people\\'s heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else\\'s critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s Psycho\\nKing of Comedy\\nFight Club\\nTaxi Driver\\nDark Knight Trilogy\\nDog Day AfternoonSo let\\'s do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the \\'Joker\\' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don\\'t make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.\\nZazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how \\'masterful\\' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.\\nThe inaccuracies are plenty as well.\\nYes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It\\'s simply NOT true to the character.Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.\\nHow does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70\\'s shock horror flicks.Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.The so-called \\'social commentary\\' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let\\'s protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it\\'s time? Watch The Truman Show.\\nThe sad pathetic irony of the causes of this \\'unrest\\' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let\\'s kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like \\'wtf just happened?\\'.Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such \\'deep\\' movies.The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it\\'s a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?\\nAnd so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that\\'s about it as far as deserving-ness.Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..But whatever. If that\\'s the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.\\nAs Shakespeare should have said, \"To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question\"', \"I didnt really know much about this movie. I hadnt seen any trailers for it or anything but i decided to give it a go while i was stoned with my mate Steve. we actually got tickets for a different movie but couldnt find our screen so we ended up in the screen showing The Joker. It wasnt til about 45 minutes in that I realised this movie is no good. I couldnt understand a lot of what certain actors were saying it was really mumbled and low quality. The story is so confusing its hard to keep track of who's who. There's a lot of scenes where literally nothing happens except for people talking or walking down corridors. I whispered to my mate Steve about an hour in to see if he thought it was as bad as i did, but he had fallen asleep.The good thing about the movie is the acting. the geezer who plays the joker is very good at it. Also there is a few very funny scenes near the end but other than that this movie is overly long, too complex, not enough action, and poor directing.\", \"I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society.\", 'I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS', \"I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you.\", 'This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Take an existing thing, make vast changes to it to the point it is no longer the thing it was, yet still call it the same thing to profit off its popularity.This story is of a loser at the end of his ropes. His life was sad, pathetic and he is powerless and thus...of course, lashes out at the world for it. This is a millennial\\'s story. A person that blames everyone else, is a victim. There is no strength in this character. He isnt scary. He isnt a thing to be feared. This so called Joker, because he is without strength, knowledge could never be what the Joker actually is. Hard to kill, vastly intelligent and a criminal master-mind.Besides undermining every single thing that is the Joker\\'s history, it makes a mockery of the Batman universe. This \"man\", who has no criminal history, cant fight worth a damn and is a low-IQ nit-wit, can just magically become not only Batmans greatest enemy, but can hold his own against the most powerful mob bosses and villains in the DC Universe. Why? Because he hates the world because his life sucked.Most at this point will have gone on about the deep psychological aspect of the film and claim that only a few can understand it...it is true. It is a deep psychological look at the mind of a professional victim that has failed at life and wants to burn the world because of it all while ignoring how it could never happen because a person like this could only hope to go out with a bang, literally as weak beta males can only hope to do, or ever do. It takes personal and mental strength to because a thing that gains power, keeps it, and uses it. That, makes this movie a failure on all levels other than acting. Which is supurb. Phoenix himself would make a great Joker, if he was cast to play the actual Joker.Sadly, this movie has missed the mark on coming remotely close to being like the character that is the Joker. Any incarnation of it. At least Leto was close to the New 52 Joker, enough that makes that role, more Joker than this one.', 'This was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks!\\nPhoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!! Deniro played another version of all the parts he has played in the past few years!\\n2 stars for the chair and 1 star for the snacks, -1 stars for wasting my day!', \"I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home.\", \"The reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art\", 'Best acting and story. This is an Oscar winning movie', \"Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer. This movie is terrible.\", \"One of the worst movies I have seen in years. Best part is Cream's White Room. Director is terrible.\", \"Wow I honestly gotta tell you, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years. All from the cinematography, thumping and sadden soundtrack, all the way to the OMG performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it's dark, it's evolving, twisting and wow just you can feel deep down to your bones his emotions portraying the Joker.Just alone watching hearing The Jokers laugh is so twisty and evil and you could hear his sadness coming out from his mouth. You could hear the hours of practice just on the laugh alone and his method acting is perfectly on point along with his subtle gestures and dance that is done perfectly as the Joker should be. This movie has all the psychological twisting that made you believed and immersed into the movie, I was totally shocked and overwhelmed by everything even after I left the cinema. Just mind-blowned.When I was watching in just now in the cinema, more than half the cinema cheered and applauded on certain scenes. And almost the entire patron stayed until the last credit. If u looked closely even Joker costume were evolving and changing from time to time based on his journey and experienced and just looked at the final and true form just looked absolutely stunning. Just the excitement and the dialogues told by The Joker is just so heart-crushing and it just made me felt so bad for the Joker, and it's the first time where I sided with the evil character or maybe he is the hero of this movie, who knows ?Honestly, u have to watch it, it's one of the best performance u be watching in a Long time, movies like this deserves to be watched on the Big Screen, go find the best cinema in town and enjoy the wild ride of emotions and fear and anger, just satisfying!!\", 'Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than \"One flew over cuckoos nest\" that shows way better cruelty saddens me.', 'What a legendary character and what a legendary performance by the actor. I was not able to move on from the Heath ledger performance but this movie is totally worth it. This movie deserves an oscar. It showcased the never before seen origin of The Joker himself and you will love it.', 'I realy dont know those Masterpiece reviews its a realy boring movie whit nothing special a about it. Heath ledger its not realy happy in the grave about this movie', 'Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.', \"What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.\\nI hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight.\", 'There is doing an homage and then there is borrowing wholesale from other material.

Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.Disappointing connection to viewer.

It wasn't there.If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed.\", 'Dark, depressing and unsettling film with a haunting score. Incredible acting, directing and screenplay. Joaquin killed it. 5 out of 5 stars! Mental health is so important guys!!!', \"Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.\", 'Joker (2019) might be one of the most boring movies I\\'ve seen this year. It certainly gives Ad Astra and Hellboy a run for their money, at least.The slowness of the movie is accompanied with a score full of low notes on stringed instruments. You know, to give the impression that the movie scenes carry weight and importance. After hearing it for half an hour, it gets pretty old.Joaquin Phoenix was easily the best part of the movie. He clearly put a lot of effort into playing The Joker, but unfortunately, the script never elevates the character to be interesting or compelling. The majority of the interesting things in the movie happen to The Joker. The active choices Joker makes barely matter in the context of the film. The majority of the things we see Joker actually do are: smoking, dancing, running, getting beat up, killing, making bad jokes, and being alone. (In that order)The theme of \"Mental Illness\" is vaguely referenced multiple times in this movie. Ultimately, these references are so confusing, had no impact, and useless that they shouldn\\'t have been there at well. (As opposed to Where\\'d You Go, Bernadette, where mental illness played an important and useful role) During the movie, social services get cut. But there are no consequences to this. In fact, by this point in the movie, Joker has already killed three people and started an imaginary relationship.Anarchy also plays a prominent role. Joker winds up starting an anarchy movement after he kills three Wayne Enterprises employees. During each interaction with or even seeing the anarchy crowd, he seems really pleased with the movement, and also shows a general displeasure with wealthy people. But whenever Joker is asked about his thoughts on the subject, he keeps saying he doesn\\'t care about the politics. The message of the movie just ends up coming across as really confused because of a refusal to pick a side on anything and say something. On the surface level, it seems like the movie has a lot to say, because it keeps touching on these subjects. But it always leaves it up to the audience to determine what the film wants to say because the film says nothing.This is not a smart movie, or a powerful commentary. It\\'s what Todd Phillips thinks that kind of movie looks and feels like. But hey, at least the cinematography was decent.', 'I didn\\'t spend any money to see this movie until it was completely free for me but I still find it a waste of a ticket and my time. A while back we had gone to see a movie and then messed up my blind fiancé\\'s audio device that gives him descriptive audio for the movie and since they couldn\\'t get it to working For a good chunk of the movie they had given us free movie tickets for a future showing.So even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time no I\\'m busSo even with the fact that we did not pay for this movie I still think it was a waste of a ticket and my time.You really couldn\\'t feel bad for this character at all. And I see no connection between him and the Jokers of the past. This portrayal of the Joker is a dishonor on the original Jokers. When I went to my parents house after the movie I knew my dad had been considering going to the movie and I walked in and said don\\'t waste your money dad just wait for it to come out on demand or on Netflix.I mean you can\\'t even connect with this character on any level. And the way they per trail mental illness is just not realistic. He was just a creepy jerk. He needed to be locked a way like his mother was. But in his case he just needed to be locked up permanently in a mental facility. And at the end of the movie how they tried to make it all just because he was abused as a child. It didn\\'t even connect up with him to make it change any opinions towards him because the things he was doing don\\'t line up with a reaction to abuse as a child. Watching this movie really just felt like you were watching a movie about \"The day in the life of Creepy Pedophile\". They try to make it so you feel sorry for him but it just doesn\\'t do that.So in my opinion even if it was free like it was for me it\\'s not worth your time and money. if it wasn\\'t for the fact that I was there with my fiancé for his birthday I would\\'ve walked out of the theater. So on a scale of 1-10 stars I\\'d give it 10 thumbs down. This movie is a piece of crap. Honestly when I watch \"Descendants 3\" babysitting this week that movie was way better than this one and this was one of those strait to tv Disney Channel movie and was a Second sequel. But seriously I enjoyed watching that movie babysitting more than I like the Joker. The joker sucked that bad.', 'any motion picture that has Laurence Sheer(the cinematographer) + Joaquin Phoenix built in a Gotham setting will be a success.the movie argues that Arthur was pushed into this \"madness\" as a result of unfair, unjust and down right cruel society that Gotham was (how cliche) - nothing fun about that. a big part of the joker character (for me at least) was the joy he took in the chaos he created and this was rushed over by the director. Nothing to celebrate any where in the movie.the dialogue was extremely poor. Complexity of the character should have been exercised in words rather than just staring into mirrors and through the glass windows.some intense scenes were unnecessary. Just because it\\'s overwhelming doesn\\'t earn it the right to be part of the story.not a whole lot of originality. too many scenes were copied or \"inspired\" by and from other movies: Nolan\\'s Dark knight, Scorsese\\'s king of comedy and Taxi Driver.and ofcourse, anything that audience can\\'t relate to is justified by \"well, it\\'s joker! It\\'s not suppose to make sense\"Bottom line, don\\'t think too much of it. Not a bad movie but everyone needs to calm down or perhaps the bar is set so low now that....Oh and the \"joker laugh\"....lets just say, it was also poor.', \"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.\\nIt touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:\\nJOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.\\nGo see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well.\", 'With that being said. This is not a comicly accurate movie. It is a movie about man named Arthur fleck. Who is a clown that is a depressed person who fails at life. It\\'s modern day Hollywood trash. With all due respect to Phoenix for trying... He is by far the worst joker because of the fake back story. Unfortunately the only real positive of this story is Robert de niros character...

At the location axis chemicals and becomes Joker. He doesn\\'t take pills he doesn\\'t kill people on Subways... Hollywood\\'s version of joker falls short simply because of the story. Arthur fleck thinks Thomas Wayne is his dad? And Bruce Wayne is his brother because of his I\\'ll mom? This the best story Hollywood got seriously? In all this is a movie about a guy portraying a clown that is having a downfall in life nothing more. If you are a true DC fan.

Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham.\", \"Joaquin Phoenix's acting was outstanding but the movie just sucked... the laugh got annoying and it made the joker out to be a pussy.

With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial.

A big fan of the character and the actors themselves.I was very disappointed. The acting from this movie was brilliant without fault. I would give it 10/10 if it were based on that alone.The Joker character is supposed to be an extremely high trait psychopath absent of all rationale and sanity. The Joker character portrayed in this movie is human. It is someone who shows symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There are very few characteristics of someone that is a high trait psychopath. I have worked on psychiatric inpatient wards (including forensic) and have several degrees within the field. The Joker in this movie is a human-being that is unwell. I have done extensive research in both the fields of psychopathy and bipolar disorder. He shows symptoms of someone experiencing psychosis and very few symptoms of the dark triad (Psychopathy, Narcissism and Machiavellianism).The Joker character in the comic books and cartoons is supposed to be the most deranged killer and high trait psychopath that is INHUMANLY possible. What I saw was one of my patients suffering without help due to cuts for NHS funding, the US medical system. Adding to the stigma behind mental illness.I applaud the actors in this movie. They have represented people who experience bipolar disorder, types of schizophrenia and some personality disorder traits excellently. But this has added to the stigma of mental health difficulties. People who suffer from these conditions should not be feared.The point is..... If you ever are going to make a Joker movie again, ask for more advice from professionals.... You have added to the stigma of people who are mentally ill. Psychopathy is a trait not a disorder.Disappointed is all I can say.', 'While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When \"The End\" appeared on the screen I couldn\\'t help but think - \"That\\'s it?\"Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it\\'s mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker\\'s madness.However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don\\'t expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.This is not a bad film, but it\\'s not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin\\'s performance.', \"There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.\\nThe script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.\\nAs a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.\\nAs for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.\", 'Writer-director Todd Phillips\\'s new movie \"Joker\" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist\\'s prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.', 'I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life\\'s simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I\\'m a happy bunny. I will not let life\\'s current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world\\'s expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger\\'s Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an \"Origins\" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What\\'s his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker\\'s mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It\\'s about \"Why?\"And now I see \"Why?\"So now ask yourself... \"Why so serious?\"', 'No surprises here. This was just the same idea played over over and over. How about that Joker Ballet in the toilet?! Hilariously bad.', \"Phoneix is so complete in his portrayal of a man's irrevocable decline into insanity that Joker and Batman story line becomes merely incidental to entire narrative. Phoenix steals the show in every scene he's in and he's in every scene. He manages to create that balance between insanity (which Leto overshot) and philosophy (Which Heath Ledger nailed) whilst also giving his character a really retro vibe.The gritty and grimy hyper-realism of Gotham subverts the comic genre and makes it a movie focused on telling it's own story. If I had to compare Joker to any other movie probably it will be Taxi Driver or One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But, honestly speaking, the added layer of the Joker's nihilism and the complete lack of actual superheroes add a whole other level. In all honesty It is a cinematic experience that generates a lot of empathy and provokes a lot of thought.\", 'I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it\\'s a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn\\'t even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.Her score: 9 / 10Mom is always right.', 'Was really looking forward to seeing this film.

It\\'s not a terrible film, but it\\'s not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it\\'s trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it\\'s not really sure what it\\'s trying to say or if it\\'s even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it\\'s easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I\\'m not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it\\'s also just not that interesting. It\\'s kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That\\'s a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a \"masterpiece\" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy.', 'It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.\\nThe movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80\\'s settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.\\nThe movie does not praise violence and it\\'s far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it\\'s all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.\\nAlso, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.']\n",
