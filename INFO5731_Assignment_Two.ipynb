            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Joker is a story of an average man and a life of suffering. The rudeness, bullying, neglect of one human being to another just because he's different or weaker, plus the daily psychological and materialistic life pressures and how all of this can help delivering a man to the hands of madness.<br/><br/>The plot tells the story of a man who lives a hard life...psychological issues, financial problems, mistreated and misunderstood by most around him and his journey to madness. Not accurate to the origin stories in neither comic books nor animation, yet it's a very refreshing and mature dark take on the clown prince of crime character which I hope to be developed into a mature dark DC movies universe.<br/><br/>The film is an outstanding experience of the movie making art on every level. I practically can see an Oscar for \"Joaquin\" just for his performance in the TV show interview scene and how realistic, pure, raw angry, mad and brutal it feels, not to mention his acting throughout the whole movie!<br/><br/>What I take on this film is the lack of an effective positive character, the plot should have shed some light on a least one positive key figures. After all, not all human beings are rude and have a negative selfish influence on their society.<br/><br/>Joker to me is a life journey, many may feel sympathy for him, some may even feel related to him or to what he has socially experienced while others will deny his actions. It's very understood to have mixed feelings about this film, I know this movie will be perceived by each viewer differently basically according to their life experiences, how they were raised and may be even their moral values.<br/><br/>I for one believe that it should not be misunderstood as an incitement to violence but more of a wake up call for all of us, a fresh look at ourselves and our social actions towards everyone we encounter in our lives and deeply reconsider how we treat each other in our daily lives and how it can shape our future society.</div>\n",

Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing.

Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director</div>, <div class=\"actions text-muted\">\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.<br/><br/>If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Joker is directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded and thrown out of society.<br/><br/>We live in an era in which formulaic comic book movies are more and more common. Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.<br/><br/>If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.<br/><br/>The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.<br/><br/>My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.<br/><br/>I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.<br/><br/>Final Grade - 9/10</div>\n",

Joker not only proves that you can make a comic book movie without a villain but also proves that comic book movies can be used as psychological studies reflecting on how our society views and treats mental health issues of certain individuals.<br/><br/>If I had to describe Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker in one word it would be mesmerising. His take on the iconic comic book character is filled with emotional depth to the point where it's almost painful to watch and flawlessly realistic making it one of the best performances of the decade.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also something to note. It is full of gorgeous shots with a beautiful colour palette making it's shot composition and structure heavily differ from most comic book films.<br/><br/>The score is very minimalistic but every time it comes on it feels unsettling and haunting which adds to the suspense of the story.<br/><br/>My biggest and only issue with Joker is that it's too inspired by Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver making the majority of the film predictable. However, making it predictable didn't take away much from its quality and only made it more unsettling because we can see the degradation of Joker's mind before it happens making this film more depressing.<br/><br/>I wouldn't really call Joker a comic book movie. Yes, it's based on a comic book and depicts arguably the most iconic comic book character of all time, but it stands alone among dozens of its predecessors as a psychological drama that reflects on society and its issues rather than a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Overall, Joker is a brilliant take on the character, however, it's not for the faint of heart or narrow-minded and prejudiced people.<br/><br/>Final Grade - 9/10</div>\n",

            "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.\n",
            "What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.<br/><br/>\n",
            "Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.\n",

At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.<br/><br/>I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.<br/><br/>Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing</div>\n",
